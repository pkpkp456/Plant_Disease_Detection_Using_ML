## 🔬 About

This is an intelligent **Plant Disease Detection Web App** built using a fine-tuned deep learning model. Upload an image of a plant leaf 🌱, and the system will:

- 🧠 **Predict the disease** (if any)
- 💬 **Fetch a full explanation** with:
  - Causes
  - Spread rate
  - Management difficulty
  - Treatments & suggested pesticides
- 🔍 Provide **reference images and Google links** to help visually verify

It uses:
- 📦 TensorFlow for model inference
- 💬 OpenAI's GPT-4o for rich contextual disease information
- 🌐 Flask + Bootstrap for a clean UI
- 🚀 Ngrok for public access link

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Upload any leaf image (JPG/PNG)  
✅ Automatic disease prediction with confidence  
✅ Full disease explanation using AI (cause, spread, treatment, etc.)  
✅ Google Image Search buttons for more examples  
✅ Fully responsive design (Bootstrap)  
✅ Clean UI + animated results  
✅ Deployable locally and publicly via ngrok
